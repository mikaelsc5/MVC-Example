MVC-Example based on Skeletor
========

MVC-Example was written for the lecture [Structuring the JavaScript Client with MVC](http://static.sc5.io/presentations/2012-11-08_structuring-the-javascript-client-with-mvc.pdf) the recording will be available on [HTML5JKL](http://html5jkl.com/lectures/).
MVC-Example uses RequireJS to handle modules.
It uses Backbone.js as the MV* Framework.
The code includes console.logs for you to follow the execution.

Skeletor is a [Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) template for a single-page app that uses [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/).
